OKUPDATE UPDATE FILE

As this project serves as a tutorial on the platform, you can update this read.me file provided to you and provide screenshots in your code in a public folder or shareable links, as you like, then push your updates with commits and verify tasks when completed.

To verify task compliance and validate it from active to completed, you must provide in the commit message:

- The task type (improvement = imp, bug = bug, feature = feat, documentation = docs)
- The task title
- (Optional) If committing the task in multiple commits, use p2 flag (p for parts) + part details (for context) for second commit, p3 for third commit, p4 for fourth commit, and so on, for any additional commit, in order for our system to find it, you can see parts as subtasks and parts details as the description of that subtask.

Example commit message: imp Modal Variations for Developers
This will allow to validate the last task you can see above on the screenshot

Another example:

TASK-007: Improvement Job proposal 3 on Freelancer

Your commit messages will look like:

- imp Job proposal 3 on Freelancer (you can include a screenshot of your cover letter after you applied to a job)
- imp Job proposal 3 on Freelancer p2 viewed (your proposal was viewed? Share another screenshot)
- imp Job proposal 3 on Freelancer p3 interviewed (You got interviewed? Share a screenshot of the conversation)
- imp Job proposal 3 on Freelancer p4 hired (You got hired? Congratulations! You can now complete the task and start managing your client’s project in okupdate.dev)

Once you validate all your tasks, the contract is considered completed.
